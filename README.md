# Augmented Matrix Assist Program
Digitizes the process of solving an augmented matrix. Created because I got tired of writing stuff down in my Linear Algebra class.

## Use
* Runs in the terminal
* All input must be in the format of numbers seperated by spaces, without commas. The program reminds you of this the first time an input requires multiple numbers. 
* The program will not end unless you tell it to stop or the tab closes, because it can't tell whether or not the matrix is "solved". This is designed to be a homework assist tool, and as such it does not solve the problem for you.

## To Do
* Get the undo functionality working
* fix display of -0 instead of 0

## Authors
* Stephen Nielsen
